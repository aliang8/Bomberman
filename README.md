# Bomberman #
Making Bomberman for APCS Spring Final Project

##Team Name: Ziggs##

##Project Name/ Description: ##

Name: BombCraft

Name: Operation BumberMan/ BombCraft

Description: We want to create a replica of the game Bomberman. The objective of the game
is to kill enemies using bombs. You can pick up powerups to gain an advantage/disadvantage 
over your opponent. You want to be the last player standing. There will be a level editor 
to allow players to create their own maps. We will also implement AI to create bots that players
can practice against. There will be three different AI difficulty levels: easy, normal, hard. 
Lastly, we will TRY to implement a 3-D version of the game.
